# crewborg — deferred tasks

Tasks intentionally **parked to handle later** — work you (or the human) decided not to do *now* but
don't want to lose. This is the player's backlog.

**Why this file matters.** Optimization throws off side-quests: a refactor you noticed but shouldn't
chase mid-experiment, a cross-cutting fix that's out of scope for the current change, a follow-up an
eval revealed. Without a parking lot they're either lost or they derail the current thread. This file
keeps them recoverable so a future session can pick them up with the context intact.

## How to use it

- **Check `Open` at the start of focused work** — it's the standing backlog.
- **Add an item whenever you defer something mid-session.** Write *what* the task is, *why* it was
  deferred, and **enough context that a future agent can act on it without this conversation** (the
  files involved, the constraint, the reference implementation to copy). Date it.
- **Move an item to `Done` when it's complete** with a one-line outcome (and note any nuance vs the
  original ask). Prune `Done` periodically — it's a short record, not an archive (finished work lives
  in git history and the [version log](../crewborg/version_log.md)).

Keep entries scoped and actionable. A vague "improve the imposter" is not a parked task; "factor the
post-kill re-approach into a dedicated state spanning Evade→Search (see imposter-play.md)" is.

## What does NOT go here

- **The current objective / live state** → [`WORKING_CONTEXT.md`](WORKING_CONTEXT.md) (TODO is *parked*
  work; working context is what you're doing *now*).
- **Candidate learnings** → [`TENTATIVE_LESSONS.md`](TENTATIVE_LESSONS.md).
- **Standing human preferences** → [`user_preferences.md`](user_preferences.md).
